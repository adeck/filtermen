CSE462 Project Repo:

The following pipelines are in this repository:

1. Polarized Image Pipeline for Prof. Viktor Gruev
2. Gamma-Ray Telescope Data Compression (VERITAS) for Prof. Mark Franklin

Naming Conventions:

For every kernel written in this repository, if that kernel is intended for VERITAS, begin the file name with the tag "VER_" followed by the kernel name (e.g. "VER_BorderExt.scala"). Likewise, please begin every kernel for the Polarized Image Pipeline with the tag "PolPipe_".
